Happy New Year, everyone.
I have been busy rebalancing over the last couple of weeks. 
The rebalancing process is still ongoing, but I wanted to share my views before it becomes too late.


Starting with liquidity, I anticipate a relatively large amount of liquidity moving from financial markets into the real economy in the United States.

Each year we get headlines like “Debt to hit record high”. But the absolute level of debt is not the main issue. 
What matters more is how much liquidity is available to support government bond auctions. In other words, the debt-to-liquidity ratio matters more.
Today, that ratio suggests that the amount of liquidity available relative to the size of debt that needs to be rolled over is lower than it was last year. 
This implies a high likelihood of liquidity being withdrawn from financial markets and redirected toward Treasuries as the government issues more bonds to refinance existing debt.


Historically, the standard solution to this scenario has been central banks purchasing government bonds—financial repression and money printing, essentially.
Theoretically, however, the issue can also be addressed by increasing the velocity of money.

As noted in the December 4th note, the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR) will take effect in April this year.
Since I have not yet built and tested a model using (Debt/Liquidity × Velocity of Money), I do not have a specific range to propose.
Still, if eSLR meaningfully increases velocity, financial markets could remain relatively stable despite liquidity flowing into the bond market.

Otherwise, quantitative easing—whether government-led or central-bank-led—will be needed to stabilize financial and repo markets.
I expect QE to occur if the eSLR effort alone proves insufficient.
Furthermore, I expect a rise not only in U.S. net liquidity but in global net liquidity, since the United States is not the only sovereign facing rollover pressure.
This global trend—which contributes to currency devaluation and de-dollarization—is one of the forces pushing gold higher, and I expect that trend to persist through 2026.


Despite this liquidity migration, I remain constructive on equities in specific sectors.
The liquidity accumulated via bond auctions and at the TGA will ultimately flow into the real economy this year.
The Trump administration has hinted at several policies that could accelerate liquidity flow into the real economy, such as the $2,000 “tariff dividend”, along with subsidies tied to the administration’s industrial strategy.
Trump’s “OBBB” framework takes effect this year and will subsidize many AI-related firms, extending the current CapEx cycle further.

The U.S. economy this year will exhibit characteristics of a state-planned economy.
While there is a strong “AI bubble” narrative, companies and sectors that are already generating profits because of the current CapEx cycle should continue to outperform.
Investors will remain cautious toward firms expanding CapEx without cash flow or revenue to justify it.

In October, I wrote:
“the momentum to be led primarily by companies in the cloud, semiconductor, and energy sectors - basically the firms that are benefiting from the current CapEx cycle. 
In particular, the companies with a PEG ratio below 1.5 could see an additional 30–60% upside from current levels.”

The company I hinted at was Micron, which has risen roughly 60% since October.
This is not a stock recommendation, nor do I know whether Micron can sustain that pace.
Having said this, my view still stands. Any company that are 'currently' generating profit by virtue of the currenct CapEx cycle will continue to out perform the market.
I remain positive sectors that are generating or expected to generate greater revenue by virtue of CapEx cycle.
My broader view still stands: companies that are profitably tied to the CapEx cycle will continue to outperform. 
I also expect the healthcare sector to outperform as it is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution.


As the size of liquidity is low compared to the size of debt, and current cash level among fund managers are low, I anticipate heghtened level of volatility in short-term. 
However, I do not anticipate long-term down trend, say 4-6 months and depth of say 30-40% drop in index. I believe such scenario is very unlikely given macro environment.

Given low liquidity relative to debt supply and low cash levels among fund managers, I expect elevated short-term volatility. 
However, I do not expect a multi-month bear trend nor a deep drawdown (e.g., 30–40%). 
Such a scenario appears unlikely under current macro conditions.

The Supreme Court ruling tomorrow could be a trigger for short-term downside. 
However, rising VIX suggests market participants are hedging through derivatives rather than liquidating positions outright.
I expect gold to continue serving as an effective hedge in this environment. 
I closed all long-term bond positions in winter 2024. While I believe long-term yields should rise, fighting state efforts to control the long end exceeds my risk tolerance. 
I do not know whether long-duration Treasuries hedge well in this environment, but if the recession narrative resurfaces, duration could perform strongly. 


In the December 18th note, I wrote:
"In a K-shaped economy, some inflation can be constructive, signaling a balance between weak middle-class purchasing power and strong upper-income demand. 
In contrast, disinflation combined with falling aggregate consumption would be a more concerning signal. "

Recently, I have observed a slightly concerning shift: upper-income consumers trading quantity over quality, which may indicate diminished purchasing power and inflation fatigue even among higher earners. 
If this trend persists throughout 2026 and becomes more pronounced, I will write a dedicated note. For now, along with planned TGA spending, I believe the issue is manageable and potentially temporary.
