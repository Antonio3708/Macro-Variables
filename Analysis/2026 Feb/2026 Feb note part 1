In my previous analysis, I anticipated that a relatively large amount of liquidity would move from financial markets into the real economy in the United States. 
I also mentioned that the amount of available liquidity is scarce relative to the size of the debt that must be rolled over this year.

To provide more detail, I have updated the model referenced on GitHub:
https://github.com/Antonio3708/Macro-Variables/blob/main/Auction%20size%20%26%20Net%20Liquidity/us%20debt%20and%20liquidity%20ratio.ipynb

There are two major findings to highlight:
  1. The 2026 net bond issuance–to–net liquidity ratio is now the third highest in 26 years. It currently stands at 4.6.
  2. The 2026 short-term bond issuance–to–net liquidity ratio is the highest in 26 years and has surpassed the 2008 level.

While the net bond issuance / net liquidity ratio is alleviated, the net amount that will be locked in to long-term bonds - the amount that won't be available for the financial market unless the government spends - will remain relatively similar to the last year’s level - 11 trillion. 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury plans to issue more short-term bonds this year. As a result, the money velocity required to sustain healthy market plumbing is higher than ever.
In simple terms, the number of times money must circulate between financial markets and the bond market is approaching historical highs, making the system more vulnerable to plumbing stress.

Compared to the previous years, specifically from 2023-2025, the jump (for both long-term and short-term bond issuance) is not as drastic. However, it must be noted that the current environment is different to 2023-2025:
From 2023 to 2025, there were excess liquidity avialable in reserve repo (RRP) account. 
Right at this moment, there is no execess liquidity avialable in the RRP. The system is way more vulnerable now than it was in 2023-2025. 


As noted in my previous analysis, there are two primary solutions:
  A. Increase money velocity (through deregulation and related measures)
  B. Central bank purchases of government bonds (i.e., financial repression or balance sheet expansion)

Currently, the ongoing Reserve Management Purchases program injects liquidity into the system by purchasing $40 billion worth of short-term Treasuries each month.
In addition, the United States is preparing to ease banking regulations through the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR), which targets money velocity. 
Under the proposed rule, the eight major banks would benefit from the eased requirements.
Based on my calculations, the major banks would gain approximately $244 billion in additional balance sheet capacity. 
Wells Fargo and Bank of America appear to benefit the most among the eight large banks.



Despite these efforts to boost money velocity and inject liquidity, the system remains in a stress-prone environment with many unknown variables. 
At least in 2026, I believe the likelihood of quantitative tightening (QT) is low. 

In a previous note on repo market stress, I mentioned that a total reserves–to–nominal GDP ratio below 11% has historically coincided with short-term funding stress. We are currently below 9%.
It is reasonable to assume that deregulation, dealer’s enlarged balance sheet capacity and faster money velocity could lower the ample-reserves floor (for example, from 11% to 8–9%). 

However, two key data points are still missing:
- Banks’ willingness to expand repo market participation after eSLR
- The shape of the reserve demand curve (precautionary demand)

If banks’ demand for reserves remains elevated despite eSLR — due to other regulatory constraints — the policy may not effectively lower the ample-reserves floor. 
In the absence of this evidence, initiating QT on the assumption that the floor has shifted could be risky.

Overall, the system remains prone to plumbing stress (reserves-to-GDP below 11% combined with the highest short-term issuance-to-liquidity ratio in 26 years), and the data regarding to the effectiveness of the proposed solutions has yet to be collected. 
The most prudent course of action would be to wait and observe how much efficiency eSLR brings to the short-term funding market, absent any urgent need for QT — which I do not currently see.


That said, support for QT is gaining some momentum among certain Federal Reserve officials following the nomination of Kevin Warsh. 
As a result, there is some risk of a policy pivot in the Reserve Management Purchases program. The Federal Reserve could slow the pace of purchases or eventually wind the program down.
If balance sheet reduction becomes the Federal Reserve’s primary objective this year, further deregulation beyond eSLR should ideally precede QT. 
In an optimal scenario, the regulatory relief would offset the liquidity impact of QT to preserve short-term funding stability. However, this scneario appears unlikely in 2026 considering the envrionment as of Feb.
