Despite the official end of QT, short-term liquidity stress remains evident — as shown by repo market activities.
To alleviate this stress, the Fed would need to purchase MBS and short-term Treasuries // balance sheet expansion, basically.

Historically, total bank reserves at the Fed / nominal GDP below roughly 11–12% has coincided with short-term liquidity problems. We are currently in the 9–10% range.
The Fed has been actively reducing its holdings of short-term Treasuries and MBS —-  drying cash and pushing up short-term repo rates — thereby worsening the liquidity squeeze. 
The depletion of the RRP also raises systemic concerns: with the RRP effectively exhausted, short-term liquidity is more vulnerable to U.S. Treasury issuance dynamics.

The elevated volatility in crypto and equities can be explained largely by de-leveraging—market makers, hedge funds, and other leveraged institutions selling assets to meet margin calls and repayment obligations. 
I disagree with the view that current market moves reflect unusually elevated fear; rather, they reflect insufficient available liquidity to absorb sell pressure.

There remains a policy gap for short-term liquidity. 
The Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR) will become effective in April next year
Unless the end of QT successfully eases short-term stresses—I expect persistent elevated volatility.

That said, short-term liquidity issues can be managed with appropriate policy tools (targeted rate cuts, balance-sheet expansion, standing repo facilities, or short-term Treasury purchases). 
On broad financial-condition metrics I see no major red flags: 
  long-term yields are trending lower—what I call a mini Operation Twist (the Fed shrinking its balance sheet while increasing long-term purchases)
  corporate spreads are subdued
  default rates remain low.

I expect the Fed to introduce targeted measures in the near term, which should accelerate the ongoing expansion and reinforce a K-shaped polarization in outcomes. // Bullish for risky assets, though
I do not expect a full-scale QE to be announced within the next month.
However, if the Treasury materially increases long-term issuance as signaled, large-scale balance-sheet expansion by the Fed would likely become inevitable.
