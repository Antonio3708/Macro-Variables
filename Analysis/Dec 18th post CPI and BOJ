Starting with major indicators, CPI and unemployment data were released this week.

In terms of CPI, market expectations for CPI were 3.0%, while the actual print came in at 2.7%, significantly below expectations.
However, much of the dataset was incomplete, with more than half of the components missing due to the government shutdown.
As a result, the release provides limited insight into underlying inflation trends, given the number of absent segments.

That said, three components are still worth highlighting: 

The first is energy. 
Energy prices were a major contributor to the lower CPI print. 
With OPEC signaling increased supply and renewed emphasis on domestic production (“drill, baby, drill”), crude oil futures have been trending lower. 
This decline was reflected in the CPI data.
I expect crude oil prices to remain a key lever in controlling inflation under the Trump administration.


The second is shelter.
The shelter component showed a sharp cooling, which has generated controversy. 
However, shelter inflation is calculated in a way that lags real economic conditions by roughly 5–6 months. 
If the government were to rely more heavily on private-sector or retail data, the observed slowdown would appear more consistent with current market conditions.


The last is food. 
The food component—arguably the segment most affected by Trump-era tariffs—was missing from the release. 
While CPI captured many of the drivers behind disinflation, it failed to reflect the segment that has experienced the most upward pressure. 
This reinforces the concern that recent CPI prints do not fully capture real-economy dynamics. 
That said, it remains uncertain whether higher food prices would have appeared in December data, as tariffs on food were later lifted.




The market expected an unemployment rate of 4.5%, while the actual print was 4.6%, slightly higher than expected.
However, the actual unemployment data could be higher than the statistics as Powell hinted. 
Unemployment data often gets revised later, so it does not serve as an optimal data point to base investment decisions. 




Overall, current macro conditions remain consistent with the outlook I published in early October:

PMI data suggest that importers are absorbing much of the cost pressure, while food importers have already passed price increases on to consumers—though this has not yet been reflected in CPI data. Meanwhile, unemployment appears sticky despite rate cuts. 
Given that productivity gains—particularly driven by AI—are a key driver, this stickiness is likely to persist.

I do not focus on a specific “danger zone” for unemployment. 
Instead, as outlined in the linked post, I closely monitor the top 10% income earners, who account for a disproportionate share of consumption. 
If job security among this group becomes threatened, that is when systemic risk becomes meaningful.

In a K-shaped economy, some inflation can be constructive, signaling a balance between weak middle-class purchasing power and strong upper-income demand. 
In contrast, disinflation combined with falling aggregate consumption would be a more concerning signal. 
At present, I do not see evidence of this dynamic.


Following the Bank of Japan’s rate hike, both crypto and equity markets rallied, suggesting that the move was well absorbed. 
As discussed in my December 11 note, BIS cross-border data and CFTC positioning indicate that institutions had already reduced yen carry trade exposure ahead of the meeting. 
It is therefore difficult to attribute recent volatility to a yen carry unwind.

Vincent Mortier, CIO at Amundi, noted that “(the rates set by) the BOJ are far from levels that could really disrupt markets.” 
He also highlighted that, after currency hedging costs, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yields only around 1.2% for Japanese investors (4.1% minus 2.9%).

Following the meeting, the 10-year JGB yield rose above 2%, as markets interpreted the BOJ’s stance as less aggressive on inflation. 
If this trend persists, the BOJ may be forced to consider balance-sheet expansion focused on long-term bonds sooner than expected.


In the next note, I will extend this topic and share my market outlook. 

Lastly, If you are reading this,
Again, Thank you very much for your response Mr. Mortier!
