Under a non-recessionary environment, the Fed generally shows less optimism when it cuts rates. This is intuitive: rate cuts typically reflect concerns about weakening economic performance.

Rate cuts
- Whether the Fed’s stance becomes more dovish or more hawkish relative to the prior meeting does not appear to determine the direction of stock prices.
  (Tested using data from 2008–2025.)
- From the rate-cut announcement date to one week after, the S&P 500 has generally shown weaker performance.
  (I did not separately test the rate cuts that occurred in December.)
- In contrast, the pre-cut period—especially during the Fed blackout window—tends to show stronger performance compared to the post-cut period.
  (I closed my TQQQ position today.)

Overall, I do not expect a strong rally following rate cuts.
The historical data does not support strong post-cut rallies unless the Fed delivers a deeper or unexpected cut.
