Observations:
- Recent volatility and the downward trend in financial markets can be explained by a lack of liquidity at financial institutions.
- A Total Reserves / Nominal GDP ratio below 11–12% is often associated with short-term liquidity shocks (e.g., widening spreads).

Rationale
- A decline in total reserves held at Federal Reserve Banks indicates a reduction in the liquidity available to large banks and depository institutions.
- Lower liquidity and capital levels at major banks often trigger increased interbank borrowing and asset sell-offs.

Use
- The ratio can serve as an indicator of overall liquidity conditions—whether liquidity is abundant, ample, or scarce.
- There is a statistically meaningful negative correlation between the studied ratio and stock-market volatility.

/// When the ratio falls below a certain threshold, we can reasonably expect the stock market to become more sensitive to news, even news that previously had little impact.
