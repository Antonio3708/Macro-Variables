Universal standard deviation 1993–2025 / This can be adjusted

This simple model is designed to identify the Fed’s policy (liquidity) regime and is not a replacement for the Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index.

Simplified formula:
Liquidity Score = Change in the Fed policy rate + Change in the Fed balance sheet + Change in the Fed’s long-term bond purchases

This model places emphasis on the Fed’s long-term bond purchase activity, as I believe that buying long-term Treasuries is significantly more effective than buying short-term Treasuries in easing financial conditions.
Because this model uses a universal sigma, it is not appropriate for identifying short-term policy actions by the Fed. (Model will probably underestimate the size of the operation as 2008 and post covide effort were great)

This modle can be used quite effectively when used with...

Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index / Highly recommend
